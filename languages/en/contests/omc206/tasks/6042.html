<p>Reiko has five children: Ichiro, Jiro, Saburo, Shiro, and Goro. Now, she decided to give them New Year's money.<br/> Reiko prepared 20 ten-thousand yen bills, 5 five-hundred yen coins, 4 one-hundred yen coins, 3 ten yen coins, and 2 one yen coins, and handed out the money to the children so that none was left over. From her experience, Reiko knows the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each child will only complain if the number of ten-thousand yen bills they received is less than or equal to the total number of other coins.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many combinations of distributing the New Year's money are there such that none of the quintuplets will complain?</p>
