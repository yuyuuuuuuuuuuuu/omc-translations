<p>Let \( A \) be the set of all numbers that can be expressed in the form \( 2^S \times 3^E \times 5^G \), where \( S, E, G \) are integers between \( 0 \) and \( 99 \). We seek to determine the maximum possible number of elements in a subset of \( A \) that satisfies the following condition:</p>
<ul>
<li>For any two distinct elements, their product is not equal to \( 2^{100} \times 3^{100} \times 5^{100} \).</li>
</ul>
