<p>Let \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{1000} \) be a permutation of \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 1000 \). We define \( N \) as the number of integers \( i \) (where \( i \) is a positive integer less than or equal to \( 999 \)) such that \( a_i &gt; a_{i+1} \). We are to find the average \( M \) of \( N^2 \) over all \( 1000! \) permutations. Note that \( M \) can be expressed as \( \frac{a}{b} \) with \( a \) and \( b \) being coprime positive integers, and the final answer will be \( a + b \).</p>
