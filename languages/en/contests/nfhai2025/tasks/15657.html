<ul>
<li>ipha goes first, and UNOwen goes second.</li>
<li>When it's their turn, they can take either the first stone from the left or both the first and second stones from the left, provided that at least one of the stones taken is white. If a player cannot make this move, they lose the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>　wasab1 wants to arrange the stones in such a way that ipha always wins, regardless of UNOwen's moves. How many such arrangements of stones are there?</p>
