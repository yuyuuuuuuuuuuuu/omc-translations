<p> There is a figure made up of <span class="katex">36</span> regular triangles, each with a side length of <span class="katex">1</span>, as shown in the left diagram. Additionally, there are <strong>tiles</strong> formed by combining <span class="katex">3</span> regular triangles, also with a side length of <span class="katex">1</span>, as shown in the right diagram, totaling <span class="katex">12</span> tiles. How many ways can the figure in the left diagram be completely covered with the tiles without any gaps or overlaps? Note that rotations and reflections that match are counted as different arrangements. </p>
