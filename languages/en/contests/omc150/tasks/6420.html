<p>Assign a positive integer to each face of a cube and then assign numbers to all edges and vertices according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each edge, assign the product of the two numbers assigned to the two faces that share that edge.</li>
<li>For each vertex, assign the product of the three numbers assigned to the three faces that share that vertex.</li>
</ul>
<p>After assigning numbers to all faces, edges, and vertices in this way, the total of the 26 assigned numbers is distinct, and the sum of these 26 numbers is 1154.<br/> Let \( S \) be the sum of the largest and smallest of the 8 numbers assigned to the vertices. Please find the total sum of all possible values of \( S \).</p>
