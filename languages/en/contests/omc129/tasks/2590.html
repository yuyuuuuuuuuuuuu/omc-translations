<p>In a train in the OMC kingdom, there are 7 seats lined up, and each seat can accommodate 1 person. However, due to an epidemic in the OMC kingdom, it is prohibited for people to sit in adjacent seats at the same time. When the people are <strong>indistinguishable</strong>, how many ways can 1 or more people sit in these seats? Note that arrangements that match by reversal are also considered distinct.</p>
