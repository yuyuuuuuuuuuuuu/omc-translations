<p> Let triangle $ABC$ be an acute triangle such that $AB < AC$, with circumcenter $O$, circumcircle $\Gamma$, and incenter $I$. Let the intersection of line $BO$ and side $AC$ be point $D$. The circumcircle $\omega$ of triangle $AOD$ is tangent to line $AB$. Let $E$ be the point that is not $A$ among the intersection points of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$, and let $F$ be the point that is not $E$ among the intersection points of $\omega$ and line $BE$. Let $X$ be the intersection of line $AO$ and line $DE$, then</p>

<p> holds. At this time, the length of segment $FI$ can be expressed using positive integers $a,b$ as $\sqrt{a}-b$, so please find the value of $a+b$.</p>
