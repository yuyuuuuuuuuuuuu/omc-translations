<p>AT and 0105 each received pocket money. However, 0105 received only half the pocket money of AT, and sympathetic AT decided to give 5000 yen from his pocket money to 0105. As a result, 0105's final pocket money became three times that of AT's final amount. When the final pocket money of AT is N yen, please solve for N.</p>
