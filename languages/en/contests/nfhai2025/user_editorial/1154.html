<p> A solid contained within a cube that appears the same as the cube when viewed from any of the three perpendicular directions to its faces is called an <strong>imaginary cube</strong>. A convex one is referred to as a convex imaginary cube, and among convex imaginary cubes, the one with the smallest volume is called a <strong>minimal convex imaginary cube</strong>.</p>
<p> For example, the cube itself is an imaginary cube, but it is not minimal. The solid formed by connecting the midpoints of all the edges is a minimal imaginary cube.</p>
