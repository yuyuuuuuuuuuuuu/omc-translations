<p> There are two universities, and 10 students from each will participate in a party. Initially, the participants are arranged into 5 groups of 4 people each, with 2 students from each university in every group.<br/> Now, to deepen the participants' friendship, we decided to rearrange the groups. At this time, we must rearrange the groups so that there are still 2 students from each university in each group, and the following conditions must be satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no pairs of students who were in the same group before and after the rearrangement (regardless of whether the two students are from the same university).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the initial arrangement is fixed, how many ways are there to rearrange the groups while satisfying these conditions?<br/> Note that the groups themselves are indistinguishable (i.e., we only consider the division of students).</p>
