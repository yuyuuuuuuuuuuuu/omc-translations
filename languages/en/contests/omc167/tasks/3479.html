<p> OMC-kun is a member of a certain club. Upon learning that there is a schedule for practice for 13 consecutive days, OMC-kun decided to take a break from the practice at least once due to the hassle, according to the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not take a break for more than 2 consecutive days.</li>
<li>Participate in at least 9 of the 13 practice sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, how many ways can OMC-kun choose the days to take a break over the entire 13 days?</p>
