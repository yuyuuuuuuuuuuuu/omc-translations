<p>In combinatorial problems, when asked to "find the sum of products/arithmetic mean," it is often the case that it involves "the inversion of roles of multiple elements" or "the typical sum of products." This problem can be solved immediately using the former. Therefore, I have compiled problems that utilize these two techniques. Since they are similar methods, learning them simultaneously will expand the range of problems you can solve quickly. Please refer to them.</p>
