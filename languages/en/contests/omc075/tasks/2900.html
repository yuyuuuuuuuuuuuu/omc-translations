<p> Find the sum of \( mn \) for all pairs of integers \( (m,n) \) such that \( 1 \leq m, n \leq 10 \) and both \( m+n \) and \( m-n \) are perfect squares.</p>
<ul>
<li> \( m+n \) and \( m-n \) are both perfect squares.</li>
</ul>
<p> A perfect square is a non-negative integer that can be expressed as the square of some integer, specifically including \( 0 \).</p>
